Please see the [Ionic Native documentation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/) for complete instructions on how to add and use the plugins.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nFor the full Ionic Native documentation, please visit [https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/](https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/).\r\n\r\n### Basic Usage\r\n\r\nTo use a plugin, import and add the plugin provider to your `@NgModule`, and then inject it where you wish to use it.\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n// app.module.ts\r\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  ...\r\n\r\n  providers: [\r\n    ...\r\n    Camera\r\n    ...\r\n  ]\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule { }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Geolocation } from '@ionic-native/geolocation';\r\nimport { Platform } from 'ionic-angular';\r\n\r\nimport { NgZone } from '@angular/core';\r\n\r\n@Component({ ... })\r\nexport class MyComponent {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private geolocation: Geolocation, private platform: Platform) {\r\n\r\n    platform.ready().then(() => {\r\n\r\n      // get position\r\n      geolocation.getCurrentPosition().then(pos => {\r\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\r\n      });\r\n\r\n\r\n      // watch position\r\n      const watch = geolocation.watchPosition().subscribe(pos => {\r\n        console.log(`lat: ${pos.coords.latitude}, lon: ${pos.coords.longitude}`)\r\n        this.position = pos;\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      // to stop watching\r\n      watch.unsubscribe();\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mocking and Browser Development\r\n\r\nIonic Native 3.x makes it possible to mock plugins and develop nearly the entirety of your app in the browser or in `ionic serve`.\r\n\r\nTo do this, you need to provide a mock implementation of the plugins you wish to use. Here's an example of mocking the `Camera` plugin to return a stock image while in development:\r\n\r\nFirst import the `Camera` class in your `src/app/app.module.ts` file:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen create a new class that extends the `Camera` class with a mock implementation:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\r\n  getPicture(options) {\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, override the previous `Camera` class in your `providers` for this module:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nproviders: [\r\n  { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's the full example:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { NgModule, ErrorHandler } from '@angular/core';\r\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\r\nimport { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular';\r\nimport { MyApp } from './app.component';\r\nimport { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';\r\n\r\nimport { Camera } from '@ionic-native/camera';\r\n\r\nclass CameraMock extends Camera {\r\n  getPicture(options) {\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\r\n      resolve(\"BASE_64_ENCODED_DATA_GOES_HERE\");\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@NgModule({\r\n  declarations: [\r\n    MyApp,\r\n    HomePage\r\n  ],\r\n  imports: [\r\n    BrowserModule,\r\n    IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)\r\n  ],\r\n  bootstrap: [IonicApp],\r\n  entryComponents: [\r\n    MyApp,\r\n    HomePage\r\n  ],\r\n  providers: [\r\n    {provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: IonicErrorHandler},\r\n    { provide: Camera, useClass: CameraMock }\r\n  ]\r\n})\r\nexport class AppModule {}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Runtime Diagnostics\r\n\r\nSpent way too long diagnosing an issue only to realize a plugin wasn't firing or installed? Ionic Native lets you know what the issue is and how you can resolve it.\r\n\r\n![img](https://ionic-io-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/ionic-native-console.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Plugin Missing?\r\nLet us know or submit a PR! Take a look at [the Developer Guide](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/master/DEVELOPER.md) for more on how to contribute. :heart:\r\n\r\n## Ionic v1 (AngularJS, Angular 1.x) support\r\n\r\nFor Ionic v1 (AngularJS, Angular 1.x) support, please use version 2 of Ionic Native. See the [2.x README](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-native/blob/v2.x/README.md) for usage information.\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\nIbby Hadeed - [@ihadeed](https://github.com/ihadeed)\r\n\r\nTim Lancina - [@timlancina](https://twitter.com/timlancina)\r\n\r\nMike Hartington - [@mhartington](https://twitter.com/mhartington)\r\n\r\nMax Lynch - [@maxlynch](https://twitter.com/maxlynch)\r\n\r\nRob Wormald - [@robwormald](https://twitter.com/robwormald)"

As a simple example, most of my code looks\nlike this:\n\n```javascript\n    var assert = require('assert-plus');\n\n    function fooAccount(options, callback) {\n        assert.object(options, 'options');\n        assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');\n        assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');\n        assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');\n        assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');\n        assert.func(callback, 'callback');\n\n        // Do stuff\n        callback(null, {});\n    }\n```\n\n# API\n\nAll methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to\ntake an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`\nwill be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:\n\n    AssertionError: foo (string) is required\n    at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)\n    at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)\n    at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)\n    at Object..js (module.js:464:10)\n    at Module.load (module.js:353:31)\n    at Function._load (module.js:311:12)\n    at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)\n    at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)\n\nfrom:\n\n```javascript\n    function test(foo) {\n        assert.string(foo, 'foo');\n    }\n```\n\nThere you go.

Using them directly from\nthe `assert` module avoids this behavior.\n\nThe complete list of APIs is:\n\n* assert.array\n* assert.bool\n* assert.buffer\n* assert.func\n* assert.number\n* assert.finite\n* assert.object\n* assert.string\n* assert.stream\n* assert.date\n* assert.regexp\n* assert.uuid\n* assert.arrayOfArray\n* assert.arrayOfBool\n* assert.arrayOfBuffer\n* assert.arrayOfFunc\n* assert.arrayOfNumber\n* assert.arrayOfFinite\n* assert.arrayOfObject\n* assert.arrayOfString\n* assert.arrayOfStream\n* assert.arrayOfDate\n* assert.arrayOfRegexp\n* assert.arrayOfUuid\n* assert.optionalArray\n* assert.optionalBool\n* assert.optionalBuffer\n* assert.optionalFunc\n* assert.optionalNumber\n* assert.optionalFinite\n* assert.optionalObject\n* assert.optionalString\n* assert.optionalStream\n* assert.optionalDate\n* assert.optionalRegexp\n* assert.optionalUuid\n* assert.optionalArrayOfArray\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBool\n* assert.optionalArrayOfBuffer\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFunc\n* assert.optionalArrayOfNumber\n* assert.optionalArrayOfFinite\n* assert.optionalArrayOfObject\n* assert.optionalArrayOfString\n* assert.optionalArrayOfStream\n* assert.optionalArrayOfDate\n* assert.optionalArrayOfRegexp\n* assert.optionalArrayOfUuid\n* assert.AssertionError\n* assert.fail\n* assert.ok\n* assert.equal\n* assert.notEqual\n* assert.deepEqual\n* assert.notDeepEqual\n* assert.strictEqual\n* assert.notStrictEqual\n* assert.throws\n* assert.doesNotThrow\n* assert.ifError\n\n# Installation\n\n    npm install assert-plus\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\nCopyright (c) 2012 Mark Cavage\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

You can pass in\n\n - a string, which it will parse as an bigInt and throw an `\"Invalid integer\"` error if the parsing fails.\n - a Javascript number, which it will parse as an bigInt and throw an `\"Invalid integer\"` error if the parsing fails.\n - another bigInt.\n - nothing, and it will return `bigInt.zero`.\n\n If you provide a second parameter, then it will parse `number` as a number in base `base`. Note that `base` can be any bigInt (even negative or zero). The letters \"a-z\" and \"A-Z\" will be interpreted as the numbers 10 to 35. Higher digits can be specified in angle brackets (`<` and `>`).\n\nExamples:\n\n    var zero = bigInt();\n    var ninetyThree = bigInt(93);\n\tvar largeNumber = bigInt(\"75643564363473453456342378564387956906736546456235345\");\n\tvar googol = bigInt(\"1e100\");\n\tvar bigNumber = bigInt(largeNumber);\n\t \n\tvar maximumByte = bigInt(\"FF\", 16);\n\tvar fiftyFiveGoogol = bigInt(\"<55>0\", googol);\n\nNote that Javascript numbers larger than `9007199254740992` and smaller than `-9007199254740992` are not precisely represented numbers and will not produce exact results. If you are dealing with numbers outside that range, it is better to pass in strings.\n\n### Method Chaining\n\nNote that bigInt operations return bigInts, which allows you to chain methods, for example:\n\n    var salary = bigInt(dollarsPerHour).times(hoursWorked).plus(randomBonuses)\n\n### Constants\n\nThere are three named constants already stored that you do not have to construct with the `bigInt` function yourself:\n\n - `bigInt.one`, equivalent to `bigInt(1)`\n - `bigInt.zero`, equivalent to `bigInt(0)`\n - `bigInt.minusOne`, equivalent to `bigInt(-1)`\n \nThe numbers from -999 to 999 are also already prestored and can be accessed using `bigInt[index]`, for example:\n\n - `bigInt[-999]`, equivalent to `bigInt(-999)`\n - `bigInt[256]`, equivalent to `bigInt(256)`\n\n### Methods\n\n#### `abs()`\n\nReturns the absolute value of a bigInt.\n\n - `bigInt(-45).abs()` => `45`\n - `bigInt(45).abs()` => `45`\n\n#### `add(number)`\n\nPerforms addition.\n\n - `bigInt(5).add(7)` => `12`\n \n[View benchmarks for this method](http://peterolson.github.io/BigInteger.js/benchmark/#Addition)\n\n#### `and(number)`\n\nPerforms the bitwise AND operation. The operands are treated as if they were represented using [two's complement representation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement).\n\n - `bigInt(6).and(3)` => `2`\n - `bigInt(6).and(-3)` => `4`\n\n#### `compare(number)`\n\nPerforms a comparison between two numbers.

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be\n  added to the result to make it positive\n\n### Postfixes\n\nThe only available postfix at the moment is:\n\n* `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript\n  Number. Decimals are not supported.\n\n### Examples\n\n* `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`\n* `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value\n* `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13\n\n## Instructions\n\nPrefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be\neither `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).\n\n### Utilities\n\n* `a.clone()` - clone number\n* `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes\n* `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)\n* `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)\n* `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero\n  pad to length, throwing if already exceeding\n* `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,\n  which must behave like an `Array`\n* `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For\n  compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:\n  `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`\n* `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied\n* `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits\n  (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)\n* `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied\n* `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative\n* `a.isEven()` - no comments\n* `a.isOdd()` - no comments\n* `a.isZero()` - no comments\n* `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)\n  depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)\n* `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)\n* `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)\n* `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width\n* `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width\n* `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance\n\n### Arithmetics\n\n* `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)\n* `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)\n* `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)\n* `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)\n* `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`\n* `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)\n* `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)\n* `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division\n\n### Bit operations\n\n* `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced\n  with `andn` in future)\n* `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`\n* `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)\n* `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set\n* `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)\n* `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number\n* `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)\n\n### Reduction\n\n* `a.gcd(b)` - GCD\n* `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)\n* `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`\n\n## Fast reduction\n\nWhen doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to\nuse some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm\nfor [Mersenne Prime][1].\n\n### Reduction context\n\nTo enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(num);\n```\nwhere `num` is just a BN instance.\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.red(primeName);\n```\n\nWhere `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:\n\n* `'k256'`\n* `'p224'`\n* `'p192'`\n* `'p25519'`\n\nOr:\n\n```js\nvar red = BN.mont(num);\n```\n\nTo reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than\n`.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.\n\n### Converting numbers\n\nBefore performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted\nto it. Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material.

The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n    npm install chokidar --save\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also \n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The CordovaError class is inherited from Error, so CordovaError instances is also valid Error instances (`instanceof` check succeeds).\n\nUsage:\n\n```\nvar CordovaError = require('cordova-common').CordovaError;\nthrow new CordovaError('Some error message', SOME_ERR_CODE);\n```\n\nSee [CordovaError](src/CordovaError/CordovaError.js) for supported error codes.\n\n### `ConfigParser`\n\nExposes functionality to deal with cordova project `config.xml` files. For ConfigParser API reference check [ConfigParser Readme](src/ConfigParser/README.md).\n\nUsage:\n```\nvar ConfigParser = require('cordova-common').ConfigParser;\nvar appConfig = new ConfigParser('path/to/cordova-app/config.xml');\nconsole.log(appconfig.name() + ':' + appConfig.version());\n```\n\n### `PluginInfoProvider` and `PluginInfo`\n\n`PluginInfo` is a wrapper for cordova plugins' `plugin.xml` files. This class may be instantiated directly or via `PluginInfoProvider`. The difference is that `PluginInfoProvider` caches `PluginInfo` instances based on plugin source directory.\n\nUsage:\n```\nvar PluginInfo: require('cordova-common').PluginInfo;\nvar PluginInfoProvider: require('cordova-common').PluginInfoProvider;\n\n// The following instances are equal\nvar plugin1 = new PluginInfo('path/to/plugin_directory');\nvar plugin2 = new PluginInfoProvider().get('path/to/plugin_directory');\n\nconsole.log('The plugin ' + plugin1.id + ' has version ' + plugin1.version)\n```\n\n### `ActionStack`\n\nUtility module for dealing with sequential tasks. Provides a set of tasks that are needed to be done and reverts all tasks that are already completed if one of those tasks fail to complete. Used internally by cordova-lib and platform's plugin installation routines.\n\nUsage:\n```\nvar ActionStack = require('cordova-common').ActionStack;\nvar stack = new ActionStack()\n\nvar action1 = stack.createAction(task1, [<task parameters>], task1_reverter, [<reverter_parameters>]);\nvar action2 = stack.createAction(task2, [<task parameters>], task2_reverter, [<reverter_parameters>]);\n\nstack.push(action1);\nstack.push(action2);\n\nstack.process()\n.then(function() {\n    // all actions succeded\n})\n.catch(function(error){\n    // One of actions failed with error\n})\n```\n\n### `superspawn`\n\nModule for spawning child processes with some advanced logic.\n\nUsage:\n```\nvar superspawn = require('cordova-common').superspawn;\nsuperspawn.spawn('adb', ['devices'])\n.progress(function(data){\n    if (data.stderr)\n        console.error('\"adb devices\" raised an error: ' + data.stderr);\n})\n.then(function(devices){\n    // Do something...\n})\n```\n\n### `xmlHelpers`\n\nA set of utility methods for dealing with xml files.\n\nUsage:\n```\nvar xml = require('cordova-common').xmlHelpers;\n\nvar xmlDoc1 = xml.parseElementtreeSync('some/xml/file');\nvar xmlDoc2 = xml.parseElementtreeSync('another/xml/file');\n\nxml.mergeXml(doc1, doc2); // doc2 now contains all the nodes from doc1\n```\n\n### Other APIs\n\nThe APIs listed below are also exposed but are intended to be only used internally by cordova plugin installation routines.\n\n```\nPlatformJson\nConfigChanges\nConfigKeeper\nConfigFile\nmungeUtil\n```\n\n## Setup\n* Clone this repository onto your local machine\n    `git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/cordova-lib.git`\n* In terminal, navigate to the inner cordova-common directory\n    `cd cordova-lib/cordova-common`\n* Install dependencies and npm-link\n    `npm install && npm link`\n* Navigate to cordova-lib directory and link cordova-common\n    `cd ../cordova-lib && npm link cordova-common && npm install`"

A major or full Chromium version.\n\nReturns a string with the corresponding Electron version for a given Chromium query.\n\nIf you provide it with a major Chromium version, it will return a major Electron version:\n\n```js\nvar electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('54');\n// electronVersion is \"1.4\"\n```\n\nIf you provide it with a full Chrome version, it will return an array of full Electron versions.\n\n```js\nvar electronVersions = e2c.chromiumToElectron('56.0.2924.87');\n// electronVersions is [\"1.6.3\", \"1.6.2\", \"1.6.1\", \"1.6.0\"]\n```\n\nIf a query does not match an Electron version, it will return `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar electronVersion = e2c.chromiumToElectron('10');\n// chromeVersion is undefined\n```\n\n#### `electronToBrowserList(query)` **DEPRECATED**\nArguments:\n* Query: string or number, required. A major Electron version.\n\n_**Deprecated**: Browserlist already includes electron-to-chromium._\n\nA function that returns a [Browserslist](https://github.com/ai/browserslist) query that matches the given major Electron version. Returns a string.\n\nIf you provide it with a major Electron version, it will return a Browserlist query string that matches the Chromium capabilities:\n\n```js\nvar query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('1.4');\n// query is \"Chrome >= 53\"\n```\n\nIf a query does not match a Chromium version, it will return `undefined`.\n\n```js\nvar query = e2c.electronToBrowserList('9000');\n// query is undefined\n```\n\n### Importing just versions, fullVersions, chromiumVersions and fullChromiumVersions\nAll lists can be imported on their own, if file size is a concern.\n\n#### `versions`\n\n```js\nvar versions = require('electron-to-chromium/versions');\n```\n\n#### `fullVersions`\n\n```js\nvar fullVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-versions');\n```\n\n#### `chromiumVersions`\n\n```js\nvar chromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/chromium-versions');\n```\n\n#### `fullChromiumVersions`\n\n```js\nvar fullChromiumVersions = require('electron-to-chromium/full-chromium-versions');\n```\n\n## Updating\nThis package will be updated with each new Electron release.\n\nTo update the list, run `npm run build.js`. Requires internet access as it downloads from the canonical list of Electron versions.\n\nTo verify correct behaviour, run `npm test`."

These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.\r\n\r\nA plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.\r\n\r\n### Plugin Boilerplate\r\n```js\r\nclass MyResolverPlugin {\r\n  constructor(source, target) {\r\n    this.source = source;\r\n    this.target = target;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  apply(resolver) {\r\n    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {\r\n      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here\r\n      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Passing options from webpack\r\nIf you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresolve: {\r\n  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],\r\n  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],\r\n  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]\r\n  ...\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2016 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)",

Available in npm as *errno*.\n\n* [errno exposed](#errnoexposed)\n* [Custom errors](#customerrors)\n\n<a name=\"errnoexposed\"></a>\n## errno exposed\n\nEver find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.\n\n**By errno:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').errno[3]\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 3,\n//     \"code\": \"EACCES\",\n//     \"description\": \"permission denied\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**By code:**\n\n```js\nrequire('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY\n// → {\n//     \"errno\": 53,\n//     \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n//     \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n//   }\n```\n\n**Make your errors more descriptive:**\n\n```js\nvar errno = require('errno')\n\nfunction errmsg(err) {\n  var str = 'Error: '\n  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno\n  if (errno.errno[err.errno])\n    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description\n  else\n    str += err.message\n\n  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property\n  if (err.path)\n    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'\n\n  return str\n}\n\nvar fs = require('fs')\n\nfs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {\n  if (err)\n    console.log(errmsg(err))\n})\n```\n\n**Use as a command line tool:**\n\n```\n~ $ errno 53\n{\n  \"errno\": 53,\n  \"code\": \"ENOTEMPTY\",\n  \"description\": \"directory not empty\"\n}\n~ $ errno EROFS\n{\n  \"errno\": 56,\n  \"code\": \"EROFS\",\n  \"description\": \"read-only file system\"\n}\n~ $ errno foo\nNo such errno/code: \"foo\"\n```\n\nSupply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error heirachies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

We then take the most significant digit.\n\n**Example:** 4001.3001.0000-dev-harmony-fb aligns with 1.1.0-dev-harmony (aka 001.001.000-dev-harmony) in upstream, with our own changes on top.\n\nEsprima-FB serves as a **building block** for JSX language tools and transpiler implementations (such as [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) or [JSXDOM](https://github.com/vjeux/jsxdom)).\n\nEsprima-FB runs on many popular web browsers, as well as other ECMAScript platforms such as\n[Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino) and [Node.js](https://npmjs.org/package/esprima).\n\nFor more information on original Esprima, check the web site [esprima.org](http://esprima.org)."

AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

It provides classes for easily building\nWebSocket servers and clients in Node. It does not provide a server itself, but\nrather makes it easy to handle WebSocket connections within an existing\n[Node](http://nodejs.org/) application. It does not provide any abstraction\nother than the standard [WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/).\n\nIt also provides an abstraction for handling\n[EventSource](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) connections, which are\none-way connections that allow the server to push data to the client. They are\nbased on streaming HTTP responses and can be easier to access via proxies than\nWebSockets.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n```\n$ npm install faye-websocket\n```\n\n\n## Handling WebSocket connections in Node\n\nYou can handle WebSockets on the server side by listening for HTTP Upgrade\nrequests, and creating a new socket for the request. This socket object exposes\nthe usual WebSocket methods for receiving and sending messages. For example this\nis how you'd implement an echo server:\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    http      = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('upgrade', function(request, socket, body) {\n  if (WebSocket.isWebSocket(request)) {\n    var ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body);\n    \n    ws.on('message', function(event) {\n      ws.send(event.data);\n    });\n    \n    ws.on('close', function(event) {\n      console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n      ws = null;\n    });\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\n`WebSocket` objects are also duplex streams, so you could replace the\n`ws.on('message', ...)` line with:\n\n```js\n    ws.pipe(ws);\n```\n\nNote that under certain circumstances (notably a draft-76 client connecting\nthrough an HTTP proxy), the WebSocket handshake will not be complete after you\ncall `new WebSocket()` because the server will not have received the entire\nhandshake from the client yet. In this case, calls to `ws.send()` will buffer\nthe message in memory until the handshake is complete, at which point any\nbuffered messages will be sent to the client.\n\nIf you need to detect when the WebSocket handshake is complete, you can use the\n`onopen` event.\n\nIf the connection's protocol version supports it, you can call `ws.ping()` to\nsend a ping message and wait for the client's response. This method takes a\nmessage string, and an optional callback that fires when a matching pong message\nis received. It returns `true` if and only if a ping message was sent. If the\nclient does not support ping/pong, this method sends no data and returns\n`false`.\n\n```js\nws.ping('Mic check, one, two', function() {\n  // fires when pong is received\n});\n```\n\n\n## Using the WebSocket client\n\nThe client supports both the plain-text `ws` protocol and the encrypted `wss`\nprotocol, and has exactly the same interface as a socket you would use in a web\nbrowser. On the wire it identifies itself as `hybi-13`.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket = require('faye-websocket'),\n    ws        = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/');\n\nws.on('open', function(event) {\n  console.log('open');\n  ws.send('Hello, world!');\n});\n\nws.on('message', function(event) {\n  console.log('message', event.data);\n});\n\nws.on('close', function(event) {\n  console.log('close', event.code, event.reason);\n  ws = null;\n});\n```\n\nThe WebSocket client also lets you inspect the status and headers of the\nhandshake response via its `statusCode` and `headers` properties.\n\nTo connect via a proxy, set the `proxy` option to the HTTP origin of the proxy,\nincluding any authorization information, custom headers and TLS config you\nrequire. Only the `origin` setting is required.\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', [], {\n  proxy: {\n    origin:  'http://username:password@proxy.example.com',\n    headers: {'User-Agent': 'node'},\n    tls:     {cert: fs.readFileSync('client.crt')}\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThe `tls` value is a Node 'TLS options' object that will be passed to\n[`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback).\n\n\n## Subprotocol negotiation\n\nThe WebSocket protocol allows peers to select and identify the application\nprotocol to use over the connection. On the client side, you can set which\nprotocols the client accepts by passing a list of protocol names when you\nconstruct the socket:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client('ws://www.example.com/', ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nOn the server side, you can likewise pass in the list of protocols the server\nsupports after the other constructor arguments:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, ['irc', 'amqp']);\n```\n\nIf the client and server agree on a protocol, both the client- and server-side\nsocket objects expose the selected protocol through the `ws.protocol` property.\n\n\n## Protocol extensions\n\nfaye-websocket is based on the\n[websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\nframework that allows extensions to be negotiated via the\n`Sec-WebSocket-Extensions` header. To add extensions to a connection, pass an\narray of extensions to the `:extensions` option. For example, to add\n[permessage-deflate](https://github.com/faye/permessage-deflate-node):\n\n```js\nvar deflate = require('permessage-deflate');\n\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, [], {extensions: [deflate]});\n```\n\n\n## Initialization options\n\nBoth the server- and client-side classes allow an options object to be passed in\nat initialization time, for example:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket(request, socket, body, protocols, options);\nvar ws = new WebSocket.Client(url, protocols, options);\n```\n\n`protocols` is an array of subprotocols as described above, or `null`.\n`options` is an optional object containing any of these fields:\n\n* `extensions` - an array of\n  [websocket-extensions](https://github.com/faye/websocket-extensions-node)\n  compatible extensions, as described above\n* `headers` - an object containing key-value pairs representing HTTP headers to\n  be sent during the handshake process\n* `maxLength` - the maximum allowed size of incoming message frames, in bytes.\n  The default value is `2^26 - 1`, or 1 byte short of 64 MiB.\n* `ping` - an integer that sets how often the WebSocket should send ping frames,\n  measured in seconds\n\nThe client accepts some additional options:\n\n* `proxy` - settings for a proxy as described above\n* `tls` - a Node 'TLS options' object containing TLS settings for the origin\n  server, this will be passed to\n  [`tls.connect()`](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_options_callback)\n* `ca` - (legacy) a shorthand for passing `{tls: {ca: value}}`\n\n\n## WebSocket API\n\nBoth server- and client-side `WebSocket` objects support the following API.\n\n* <b>`on('open', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket connection is\n  established. Event has no attributes.\n* <b>`on('message', function(event) {})`</b> fires when the socket receives a\n  message. Event has one attribute, <b>`data`</b>, which is either a `String`\n  (for text frames) or a `Buffer` (for binary frames).\n* <b>`on('error', function(event) {})`</b> fires when there is a protocol error\n  due to bad data sent by the other peer. This event is purely informational,\n  you do not need to implement error recover.\n* <b>`on('close', function(event) {})`</b> fires when either the client or the\n  server closes the connection. Event has two optional attributes, <b>`code`</b>\n  and <b>`reason`</b>, that expose the status code and message sent by the peer\n  that closed the connection.\n* <b>`send(message)`</b> accepts either a `String` or a `Buffer` and sends a\n  text or binary message over the connection to the other peer.\n* <b>`ping(message, function() {})`</b> sends a ping frame with an optional\n  message and fires the callback when a matching pong is received.\n* <b>`close(code, reason)`</b> closes the connection, sending the given status\n  code and reason text, both of which are optional.\n* <b>`version`</b> is a string containing the version of the `WebSocket`\n  protocol the connection is using.\n* <b>`protocol`</b> is a string (which may be empty) identifying the subprotocol\n  the socket is using.\n\n\n## Handling EventSource connections in Node\n\nEventSource connections provide a very similar interface, although because they\nonly allow the server to send data to the client, there is no `onmessage` API.\nEventSource allows the server to push text messages to the client, where each\nmessage has an optional event-type and ID.\n\n```js\nvar WebSocket   = require('faye-websocket'),\n    EventSource = WebSocket.EventSource,\n    http        = require('http');\n\nvar server = http.createServer();\n\nserver.on('request', function(request, response) {\n  if (EventSource.isEventSource(request)) {\n    var es = new EventSource(request, response);\n    console.log('open', es.url, es.lastEventId);\n    \n    // Periodically send messages\n    var loop = setInterval(function() { es.send('Hello') }, 1000);\n    \n    es.on('close', function() {\n      clearInterval(loop);\n      es = null;\n    });\n  \n  } else {\n    // Normal HTTP request\n    response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\n    response.end('Hello');\n  }\n});\n\nserver.listen(8000);\n```\n\nThe `send` method takes two optional parameters, `event` and `id`. The default\nevent-type is `'message'` with no ID. For example, to send a `notification`\nevent with ID `99`:\n\n```js\nes.send('Breaking News!', {event: 'notification', id: '99'});\n```\n\nThe `EventSource` object exposes the following properties:\n\n* <b>`url`</b> is a string containing the URL the client used to create the\n  EventSource.\n* <b>`lastEventId`</b> is a string containing the last event ID received by the\n  client. You can use this when the client reconnects after a dropped connection\n  to determine which messages need resending.\n\nWhen you initialize an EventSource with ` new EventSource()`, you can pass\nconfiguration options after the `response` parameter. Available options are:\n\n* <b>`headers`</b> is an object containing custom headers to be set on the\n  EventSource response.\n* <b>`retry`</b> is a number that tells the client how long (in seconds) it\n  should wait after a dropped connection before attempting to reconnect.\n* <b>`ping`</b> is a number that tells the server how often (in seconds) to send\n  'ping' packets to the client to keep the connection open, to defeat timeouts\n  set by proxies. The client will ignore these messages.\n\nFor example, this creates a connection that allows access from any origin, pings\nevery 15 seconds and is retryable every 10 seconds if the connection is broken:\n\n```js\nvar es = new EventSource(request, response, {\n  headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'},\n  ping:    15,\n  retry:   10\n});\n```\n\nYou can send a ping message at any time by calling `es.ping()`. Unlike\nWebSocket, the client does not send a response to this; it is merely to send\nsome data over the wire to keep the connection alive.\n\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (c) 2010-2015 James Coglan\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks.

The Javascript sources are meant to be used by a bundler such as Webpack, SystemJS Builder, or Browserify. The type definitions provide support to Typescript tooling for things like type checking and code completion.\n\nUsually, the only import required by the user is `ionic-angular`, as everything from Ionic is exported by the package:\n\n```\n  import { App, NavController } from 'ionic-angular';\n```\n\n### Bundles\n\nMinified and unminified CommonJS and System.register module format bundles, as well as compiled CSS stylesheets for both Ionic iOS and Material Design are located `bundles/`. The SystemJS bundle is  primarily meant to be included in a `<script>` tag for demos, tests and Javascript playgrounds like [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/).\n\n### Installation and More\n\nTo use Ionic, we recommend installing and utilizing the [Ionic CLI](http://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/installation/) which will help you create pre-configured Ionic apps.\n\nFor full instructions on using Ionic, please visit the [Ionic Documentation](http://ionicframework.com/docs/)"

You want to make some light modifications to it - replacing a few characters here and there, wrapping it with a header and footer, etc - and ideally you'd like to generate a source map at the end of it. You've thought about using something like [recast](https://github.com/benjamn/recast) (which allows you to generate an AST from some JavaScript, manipulate it, and reprint it with a sourcemap without losing your comments and formatting), but it seems like overkill for your needs (or maybe the source code isn't JavaScript).\n\nYour requirements are, frankly, rather niche. But they're requirements that I also have, and for which I made magic-string. It's a small, fast utility for manipulating strings and generating sourcemaps.\n\n## Installation\n\nmagic-string works in both node.js and browser environments. For node, install with npm:\n\n```bash\nnpm i magic-string\n```\n\nTo use in browser, grab the [magic-string.umd.js](https://unpkg.com/magic-string/dist/magic-string.umd.js) file and add it to your page:\n\n```html\n<script src='magic-string.umd.js'></script>\n```\n\n(It also works with various module systems, if you prefer that sort of thing - it has a dependency on [vlq](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/vlq).)\n\n## Usage\n\nThese examples assume you're in node.js, or something similar:\n\n```js\nvar MagicString = require( 'magic-string' );\nvar s = new MagicString( 'problems = 99' );\n\ns.overwrite( 0, 8, 'answer' );\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 99'\n\ns.overwrite( 11, 13, '42' ); // character indices always refer to the original string\ns.toString(); // 'answer = 42'\n\ns.prepend( 'var ' ).append( ';' ); // most methods are chainable\ns.toString(); // 'var answer = 42;'\n\nvar map = s.generateMap({\n  source: 'source.js',\n  file: 'converted.js.map',\n  includeContent: true\n}); // generates a v3 sourcemap\n\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js', s.toString() );\nrequire( 'fs' ).writeFile( 'converted.js.map', map.toString() );\n```\n\nYou can pass an options argument:\n\n```js\nvar s = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  // both these options will be used if you later\n  // call `bundle.addSource( s )` - see below\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  indentExclusionRanges: [/*...*/]\n});\n```\n\n## Methods\n\n### s.addSourcemapLocation( index )\n\nAdds the specified character index (with respect to the original string) to sourcemap mappings, if `hires` is `false` (see below).\n\n### s.append( content )\n\nAppends the specified content to the end of the string. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.appendLeft( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *ending* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependLeft(...)`.\n\n### s.appendRight( index, content )\n\nAppends the specified `content` at the `index` in the original string. If a range *starting* with `index` is subsequently moved, the insert will be moved with it. Returns `this`. See also `s.prependRight(...)`.\n\n### s.clone()\n\nDoes what you'd expect.\n\n### s.generateMap( options )\n\nGenerates a [version 3 sourcemap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit). All options are, well, optional:\n\n* `file` - the filename where you plan to write the sourcemap\n* `source` - the filename of the file containing the original source\n* `includeContent` - whether to include the original content in the map's `sourcesContent` array\n* `hires` - whether the mapping should be high-resolution. Hi-res mappings map every single character, meaning (for example) your devtools will always be able to pinpoint the exact location of function calls and so on. With lo-res mappings, devtools may only be able to identify the correct line - but they're quicker to generate and less bulky. If sourcemap locations have been specified with `s.addSourceMapLocation()`, they will be used here.\n\nThe returned sourcemap has two (non-enumerable) methods attached for convenience:\n\n* `toString` - returns the equivalent of `JSON.stringify(map)`\n* `toUrl` - returns a DataURI containing the sourcemap. Useful for doing this sort of thing:\n\n```js\ncode += '\\n//# sourceMappingURL=' + map.toUrl();\n```\n\n### s.indent( prefix[, options] )\n\nPrefixes each line of the string with `prefix`. If `prefix` is not supplied, the indentation will be guessed from the original content, falling back to a single tab character. Returns `this`.\n\nThe `options` argument can have an `exclude` property, which is an array of `[start, end]` character ranges. These ranges will be excluded from the indentation - useful for (e.g.) multiline strings.\n\n### s.insertLeft( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.appendLeft(...)` instead\n\n### s.insertRight( index, content )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.17 – use `s.prependRight(...)` instead\n\n### s.locate( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.locateOrigin( index )\n\n**DEPRECATED** since 0.10 – see [#30](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string/pull/30)\n\n### s.move( start, end, newIndex )\n\nMoves the characters from `start` and `end` to `index`. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.overwrite( start, end, content[, options] )\n\nReplaces the characters from `start` to `end` with `content`. The same restrictions as `s.remove()` apply. Returns `this`.\n\nThe fourth argument is optional. It can have a `storeName` property — if `true`, the original name will be stored for later inclusion in a sourcemap's `names` array — and a `contentOnly` property which determines whether only the content is overwritten, or anything that was appended/prepended to the range as well.\n\n### s.prepend( content )\n\nPrepends the string with the specified content. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.prependLeft ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendLeft(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.prependRight ( index, content )\n\nSame as `s.appendRight(...)`, except that the inserted content will go *before* any previous appends or prepends at `index`\n\n### s.remove( start, end )\n\nRemoves the characters from `start` to `end` (of the original string, **not** the generated string). Removing the same content twice, or making removals that partially overlap, will cause an error. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.slice( start, end )\n\nReturns the content of the generated string that corresponds to the slice between `start` and `end` of the original string. Throws error if the indices are for characters that were already removed.\n\n### s.snip( start, end )\n\nReturns a clone of `s`, with all content before the `start` and `end` characters of the original string removed.\n\n### s.toString()\n\nReturns the generated string.\n\n### s.trim([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimStart([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the start. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimEnd([ charType ])\n\nTrims content matching `charType` (defaults to `\\s`, i.e. whitespace) from the end. Returns `this`.\n\n### s.trimLines()\n\nRemoves empty lines from the start and end. Returns `this`.\n\n## Bundling\n\nTo concatenate several sources, use `MagicString.Bundle`:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'foo.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'var answer = 42;' )\n});\n\nbundle.addSource({\n  filename: 'bar.js',\n  content: new MagicString( 'console.log( answer )' )\n});\n\n// Advanced: a source can include an `indentExclusionRanges` property\n// alongside `filename` and `content`. This will be passed to `s.indent()`\n// - see documentation above\n\nbundle.indent() // optionally, pass an indent string, otherwise it will be guessed\n  .prepend( '(function () {\\n' )\n  .append( '}());' );\n\nbundle.toString();\n// (function () {\n//   var answer = 42;\n//   console.log( answer );\n// }());\n\n// options are as per `s.generateMap()` above\nvar map = bundle.generateMap({\n  file: 'bundle.js',\n  includeContent: true,\n  hires: true\n});\n```\n\nAs an alternative syntax, if you a) don't have `filename` or `indentExclusionRanges` options, or b) passed those in when you used `new MagicString(...)`, you can simply pass the `MagicString` instance itself:\n\n```js\nvar bundle = new MagicString.Bundle();\nvar source = new MagicString( someCode, {\n  filename: 'foo.js'\n});\n\nbundle.addSource( source );\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT"

After copying, execute `typings install`.\n\n### Atmosphere packages\n\nIf you want to install some Atmosphere package's typings, search for an appropriate repo in the current\n[`meteor-typings`](https://github.com/meteor-typings) organization, which is supposed to contain all available typings of such type.\n\nIf you have found that package's typings repo, go inside and read how to install typings.\nIf not - you are very welcome to create new repo and contribute typings.\n\n## Development\n\nIn order to build all typings run `gulp build`.\n\n`1.2` and `1.3` share the same Meteor core packages' typings, which are located in `1.2/packages`.\nWhen you run `gulp 1_3`, typings are modified to contain modules corresponding new Meteor 1.3 namespaces.\n\n## Contribution\n\nPlease make sure that you change associated Meteor packages' typings directly in `1.2/packages` and `1.3/packages` folders.\n`main.d.ts` and `browser.d.ts` are built out of them. Here are contribution steps.\n\n1. Install dependencies via `npm install` in this directory.\n2. Change typing files in the directories `1.2/packages` or/and `1.3/packages`.\n3. (Optional) Add test cases in the file `1.3/test/test.ts`.\n4. Run `npm run build+test` to generate `[1.2|1.3]/[browser.d.ts|header.d.ts|main.d.ts]` and to test typings."

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:\n\nYou must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\nYou must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and\n\nYou must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\nIf the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

    "licenseText": "# node-properties-parser\n\nA parser for [.properties](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) files written in javascript.  Properties files store key-value pairs.  They are typically used for configuration and internationalization in Java applications as well as in Actionscript projects.  Here's an example of the format:\n\n\t# You are reading the \".properties\" entry.\n\t! The exclamation mark can also mark text as comments.\n\twebsite = http://en.wikipedia.org/\n\tlanguage = English\n\t# The backslash below tells the application to continue reading\n\t# the value onto the next line.\n\tmessage = Welcome to \\\n\t          Wikipedia!\n\t# Add spaces to the key\n\tkey\\ with\\ spaces = This is the value that could be looked up with the key \"key with spaces\".\n\t# Unicode\n\ttab : \\u0009\n*(taken from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties#Format))*\n\nCurrently works with any version of node.js.\n\n## The API\n\n- `parse(text)`: Parses `text` into key-value pairs.  Returns an object containing the key-value pairs.\n- `read(path[, callback])`: Opens the file specified by `path` and calls `parse` on its content.  If the optional `callback` parameter is provided, the result is then passed to it as the second parameter.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter. If `callback` is not provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and calls `parse` on its contents.  The resulting object is immediately returned.\n- `createEditor([path[, callback]])`:  If neither `path` or `callback` are provided an empty editor object is returned synchronously.  If only `path` is provided, the file specified by `path` is synchronously read and parsed.  An editor object with the results in then immediately returned.  If both `path` and `callback` are provided, the file specified by `path` is read and parsed asynchronously.  An editor object with the results are then passed to `callback` as the second parameters.  If an error occurs, the error object is passed to `callback` as the first parameter.\n- `Editor`: The editor object is returned by `createEditor`.  Has the following API:\n\t- `get(key)`: Returns the value currently associated with `key`.\n\t- `set(key, [value[, comment]])`: Associates `key` with `value`. An optional comment can be provided. If `value` is not specified or is `null`, then `key` is unset.\n\t- `unset(key)`: Unsets the specified `key`.\n\t- `save([path][, callback]])`: Writes the current contents of this editor object to a file specified by `path`.  If `path` is not provided, then it'll be defaulted to the `path` value passed to `createEditor`.  The `callback` parameter is called when the file has been written to disk.\n\t- `addHeadComment`: Added a comment to the head of the file.\n\t- `toString`: Returns the string representation of this properties editor object.  This string will be written to a file if `save` is called.\n\n## Getting node-properties-parser\n\nThe easiest way to get node-properties-parser is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install properties-parser\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit://github.com/xavi-/node-properties-parser.git\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)."

This is a non-zero value, but you may not make any other assumptions about its value.\n\n### raf.cancel(handle)\n\n`handle` is the entry identifier returned by `raf()`. Removes the queued animation frame callback (other queued callbacks will still be invoked unless cancelled).\n\n### raf.polyfill([object])\n\nShorthand to polyfill `window.requestAnimationFrame` and `window.cancelAnimationFrame` if necessary (Polyfills `global` in node).\n\nAlternatively you can require `raf/polyfill` which will act the same as `require('raf').polyfill()`.\n\nIf you provide `object` the polyfills are attached to that given object, instead of the inferred global.\nUseful if you have an instance of a fake `window` object, and want to add `raf` and `caf` to it.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nBased on work by Erik Möller, Paul Irish, and Tino Zijdel (https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671)\n\n## License\n\nMIT"

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

According to the spec, source maps have the\nfollowing attributes:\n\n* `version`: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.\n\n* `sources`: An array of URLs to the original source files.\n\n* `names`: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual\n  mappings.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.\n\n* `sourcesContent`: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.\n\n* `mappings`: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.\n\n* `file`: Optional. The generated filename this source map is associated with.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.computeColumnSpans()\n\nCompute the last column for each generated mapping. The last column is\ninclusive.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)\n\nReturns the original source, line, and column information for the generated\nsource's line and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source.\n\n* `bias`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.LEAST_UPPER_BOUND`. Specifies whether to return the closest\n  element that is smaller than or greater than the one we are searching for,\n  respectively, if the exact element cannot be found.  Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GREATEST_LOWER_BOUND`.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The original source file, or null if this information is not\n  available.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source, or null if this information is\n  not available.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source, or null or null if this\n  information is not available.\n\n* `name`: The original identifier, or null if this information is not available.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.generatedPositionFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns the generated line and column information for the original source,\nline, and column positions provided. The only argument is an object with\nthe following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the original source.\n\nand an object is returned with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.allGeneratedPositionsFor(originalPosition)\n\nReturns all generated line and column information for the original source, line,\nand column provided. If no column is provided, returns all mappings\ncorresponding to a either the line we are searching for or the next closest line\nthat has any mappings. Otherwise, returns all mappings corresponding to the\ngiven line and either the column we are searching for or the next closest column\nthat has any offsets.\n\nThe only argument is an object with the following properties:\n\n* `source`: The filename of the original source.\n\n* `line`: The line number in the original source.\n\n* `column`: Optional. The column number in the original source.\n\nand an array of objects is returned, each with the following properties:\n\n* `line`: The line number in the generated source, or null.\n\n* `column`: The column number in the generated source, or null.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.hasContentsOfAllSources()\n\nReturn true if we have the embedded source content for every source listed in\nthe source map, false otherwise.\n\nIn other words, if this method returns `true`, then `smc.sourceContentFor(s)`\nwill succeed for every source `s` in `smc.sources`.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.sourceContentFor(source[, returnNullOnMissing])\n\nReturns the original source content for the source provided. The only\nargument is the URL of the original source file.\n\nIf the source content for the given source is not found, then an error is\nthrown. Optionally, pass `true` as the second param to have `null` returned\ninstead.\n\n#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.eachMapping(callback, context, order)\n\nIterate over each mapping between an original source/line/column and a\ngenerated line/column in this source map.\n\n* `callback`: The function that is called with each mapping. Mappings have the\n  form `{ source, generatedLine, generatedColumn, originalLine, originalColumn,\n  name }`\n\n* `context`: Optional. If specified, this object will be the value of `this`\n  every time that `callback` is called.\n\n* `order`: Either `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER` or\n  `SourceMapConsumer.ORIGINAL_ORDER`. Specifies whether you want to iterate over\n  the mappings sorted by the generated file's line/column order or the\n  original's source/line/column order, respectively. Defaults to\n  `SourceMapConsumer.GENERATED_ORDER`.\n\n### SourceMapGenerator\n\nAn instance of the SourceMapGenerator represents a source map which is being\nbuilt incrementally.\n\n#### new SourceMapGenerator([startOfSourceMap])\n\nYou may pass an object with the following properties:\n\n* `file`: The filename of the generated source that this source map is\n  associated with.\n\n* `sourceRoot`: A root for all relative URLs in this source map.\n\n* `skipValidation`: Optional. When `true`, disables validation of mappings as\n  they are added. This can improve performance but should be used with\n  discretion, as a last resort. Even then, one should avoid using this flag when\n  running tests, if possible.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.fromSourceMap(sourceMapConsumer)\n\nCreates a new SourceMapGenerator based on a SourceMapConsumer\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)\n\nAdd a single mapping from original source line and column to the generated\nsource's line and column for this source map being created. The mapping object\nshould have the following properties:\n\n* `generated`: An object with the generated line and column positions.\n\n* `original`: An object with the original line and column positions.\n\n* `source`: The original source file (relative to the sourceRoot).\n\n* `name`: An optional original token name for this mapping.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for an original source file.\n\n* `sourceFile` the URL of the original source file.\n\n* `sourceContent` the content of the source file.\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.applySourceMap(sourceMapConsumer[, sourceFile[, sourceMapPath]])\n\nApplies a SourceMap for a source file to the SourceMap.\nEach mapping to the supplied source file is rewritten using the\nsupplied SourceMap. Note: The resolution for the resulting mappings\nis the minimium of this map and the supplied map.\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer`: The SourceMap to be applied.\n\n* `sourceFile`: Optional. The filename of the source file.\n  If omitted, sourceMapConsumer.file will be used, if it exists.\n  Otherwise an error will be thrown.\n\n* `sourceMapPath`: Optional. The dirname of the path to the SourceMap\n  to be applied. If relative, it is relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  This parameter is needed when the two SourceMaps aren't in the same\n  directory, and the SourceMap to be applied contains relative source\n  paths. If so, those relative source paths need to be rewritten\n  relative to the SourceMap.\n\n  If omitted, it is assumed that both SourceMaps are in the same directory,\n  thus not needing any rewriting. (Supplying `'.'` has the same effect.)\n\n#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toString()\n\nRenders the source map being generated to a string.\n\n### SourceNode\n\nSourceNodes provide a way to abstract over interpolating and/or concatenating\nsnippets of generated JavaScript source code, while maintaining the line and\ncolumn information associated between those snippets and the original source\ncode. This is useful as the final intermediate representation a compiler might\nuse before outputting the generated JS and source map.\n\n#### new SourceNode([line, column, source[, chunk[, name]]])\n\n* `line`: The original line number associated with this source node, or null if\n  it isn't associated with an original line.\n\n* `column`: The original column number associated with this source node, or null\n  if it isn't associated with an original column.\n\n* `source`: The original source's filename; null if no filename is provided.\n\n* `chunk`: Optional. Is immediately passed to `SourceNode.prototype.add`, see\n  below.\n\n* `name`: Optional. The original identifier.\n\n#### SourceNode.fromStringWithSourceMap(code, sourceMapConsumer[, relativePath])\n\nCreates a SourceNode from generated code and a SourceMapConsumer.\n\n* `code`: The generated code\n\n* `sourceMapConsumer` The SourceMap for the generated code\n\n* `relativePath` The optional path that relative sources in `sourceMapConsumer`\n  should be relative to.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.add(chunk)\n\nAdd a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.prepend(chunk)\n\nPrepend a chunk of generated JS to this source node.\n\n* `chunk`: A string snippet of generated JS code, another instance of\n   `SourceNode`, or an array where each member is one of those things.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)\n\nSet the source content for a source file. This will be added to the\n`SourceMap` in the `sourcesContent` field.\n\n* `sourceFile`: The filename of the source file\n\n* `sourceContent`: The content of the source file\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walk(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of JS snippets in this node and its children. The walking\nfunction is called once for each snippet of JS and is passed that snippet and\nthe its original associated source's line/column location.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.walkSourceContents(fn)\n\nWalk over the tree of SourceNodes. The walking function is called for each\nsource file content and is passed the filename and source content.\n\n* `fn`: The traversal function.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.join(sep)\n\nLike `Array.prototype.join` except for SourceNodes. Inserts the separator\nbetween each of this source node's children.\n\n* `sep`: The separator.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.replaceRight(pattern, replacement)\n\nCall `String.prototype.replace` on the very right-most source snippet. Useful\nfor trimming whitespace from the end of a source node, etc.\n\n* `pattern`: The pattern to replace.\n\n* `replacement`: The thing to replace the pattern with.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toString()\n\nReturn the string representation of this source node. Walks over the tree and\nconcatenates all the various snippets together to one string.\n\n#### SourceNode.prototype.toStringWithSourceMap([startOfSourceMap])\n\nReturns the string representation of this tree of source nodes, plus a\nSourceMapGenerator which contains all the mappings between the generated and\noriginal sources.\n\nThe arguments are the same as those to `new SourceMapGenerator`.\n\n## Tests\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/source-map)\n\nInstall NodeJS version 0.8.0 or greater, then run `node test/run-tests.js`.\n\nTo add new tests, create a new file named `test/test-<your new test name>.js`\nand export your test functions with names that start with \"test\", for example\n\n```js\nexports[\"test doing the foo bar\"] = function (assert, util) {\n  ...\n};\n```\n\nThe new test will be located automatically when you run the suite.\n\nThe `util` argument is the test utility module located at `test/source-map/util`.\n\nThe `assert` argument is a cut down version of node's assert module. You have\naccess to the following assertion functions:\n\n* `doesNotThrow`\n\n* `equal`\n\n* `ok`\n\n* `strictEqual`\n\n* `throws`\n\n(The reason for the restricted set of test functions is because we need the\ntests to run inside Firefox's test suite as well and so the assert module is\nshimmed in that environment. See `build/assert-shim.js`.)\n\n[format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit\n[feature]: https://wiki.mozilla.org/DevTools/Features/SourceMap\n[Dryice]: https://github.com/mozilla/dryice"

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
