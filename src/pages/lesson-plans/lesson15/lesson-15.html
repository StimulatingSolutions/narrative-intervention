Then we stopped at the picnic table to eat some lunch. I pulled my peanut butter and jelly sandwich out of my back pack and it was all smashed! What caused my sandwich to be smashed? Putting my water bottle on top of it.

      <li>
        <p>Enter the room with the bags of wands and tricks hidden in the magician hat. Explain that today is the day when you have to show that you brought new junior magicians into the club. Display the magician’s checklist, and note that the last item is to bring new junior magicians into the club.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Explain that the children will perform their tricks and explain their trick using the completed Velcro boards from lesson 13. Ask the teacher to videotape the performances so that they can be sent to the Head Magician to prove that you brought new magicians into the club. Each child will perform and explain their trick once for practice, and then one at a time they will perform and explain the tricks while the teacher videotapes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After each of the students performs their trick, You will pretend to send the video to the Head Magician. Whoever sends the video will wait a little bit and then show the children the picture of the Head Magician giving a “thumbs-up” and say that the Head Magician texted with a picture of a “thumbs-up”! The entire group then rejoices and celebrates. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Thank the group for helping you out and pull out the checklist to note that you have now (1) found all of your inventory, (2) learned a cool new trick, and (3) brought new junior magicians into the club [places final check mark on the magician's checklist].  Then, take off your magician's hat and say, &quot;Thank you so much for helping me get back into the club.  Now I will perform my final trick, &quot;Zippity Zim, Zippity Zat, now I'll pull your reward out of this hat!&quot; You will pull the wand/trick bags out of your hat and present one to each student. [Note: the bags may be difficult to fit inside your hat. You can leave them hanging down a bit in the back and cover with the cape]. The group will celebrate with cupcakes!</p>
