      <em><strong>Overview of Procedures for the Magician Narrative</strong></em> (This is just an overview of the activity. A script follows)
    </p>
    <p><em>Before the lesson begins:</em></p>
    <ol class="numbers">
      <li>
        <p>Discuss and make arrangements with your co-teacher and with research personnel to decide where to place the 8 magic tricks (use fewer tricks depending on how many students are in your group.  You need 1 trick for the Teacher, 1 trick for the Co-Teacher, and 1 trick for each student). This should be in a room/location close to your classroom.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Undergraduate helpers or research personnel will place the 8 magic tricks and the items in which to hide them (e.g., boxes, bags) in the room/location. Place the tricks in a spot in the room/location where students can easily find them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Some teachers choose to do this lesson in their classroom. You can do that, but some students are frightened of Tatiana and then become afraid to remain in their classroom as it now seems “unsafe.” Therefore, we do not recommend that you choose this option.</p>

    <p><em>Procedure for Journey to Get the Magic Tricks and Keep them Safe:</em></p>
    <ol class="numbers">
      <li>
        <p>Take 1 Velcro board and 1 set of pre-printed cards for the Magician Narrative with you as you go to get the magic tricks so that the Co-teacher can build the board with the students as they plan their tries to hide the tricks from Tatiana.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Leave 1 Velcro board and 1 set of pre-printed cards for the Magician Narrative in the classroom so that the teacher can build the board with the students as they return to the classroom with their tricks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chart each TRY <em>before</em> the person makes their attempt to get past Tatiana.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The teacher will select one trick from the black velvet bag and make the first TRY to hide the trick from Tatiana.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After the teacher’s try, the teacher returns to the classroom and prepares to greet the children as they each make their attempts to get past Tatiana.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Chart each OUTCOME <em>before</em> the next person tries to get their trick past Tatiana.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The children should each have 1 trick from the black velvet bag and will make their TRIES next. They may go in groups of 2 to shorten the process.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The teacher will chart the remaining tries and outcomes with the children in the classroom as they come back to the classroom with their tricks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Co-teacher remains with the children where the tricks are hidden and works with the children to chart each try and outcome as it occurs (and as they await their try).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Co-teacher takes the last trick in the black velvet bag and makes the last TRY.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once everyone is back in the classroom, the entire group charts the events from Tatiana’s perspective together.</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Summary:</strong> Alex the Magician’s video shares she is attending a magician’s conference in Cincinnati learning some new magic tricks so she can back into the Magician’s Club. She has left some tricks for us somewhere in the school (e.g., the front office). She won’t be able to teach us the tricks today, but asks us to go get them and bring them back to the classroom. She warns us about her evil cousin Tatiana, who is also a magician. Alex the Magician and Tatiana have been competing for years to be the better magician, and she warns us that Tatiana will try to take the tricks, so we will need to guard them carefully so that she can teach us how to perform them when she gets back in town. She describes her cousin Tatiana, who has black and white hair and glasses. Alex the Magician should also reference the three things she has to do to get back in the club (i.e., recruit new magicians, learn a cool new trick, and have all the items in her inventory) and hold up a checklist of these requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Video Script:</strong> In the video Alex will say, “Hey guys! Alex the Magician here! I’m up in Cincinnati at a Magician’s Conference working on my checklist to get back into the club. It’s not too bad.”
        </p>
        <p>Then she will pick up a brightly colored checklist. It is a list of the tasks she has to do to get back into the Magician’s Club. She will say, “My first task is to have all my Magician’s Inventory. Well, you all found my rabbit so we’re good on that. Thank you!”</p>
        <p>She will put a check mark beside “Have all Magician’s Inventory.” Then she will say, “Done! My second task is to learn a cool new trick. Well, I’m at the magician’s conference right now. So, that shouldn’t be too hard. I’ll learn something cool and show you all when I get back. My third task is to bring in some new magicians. I’ll work on that a little later.”</p>
        <p>Then she will alert you to your new goal. She will say, “Uh, one more thing, I left some of my tricks in the school the other day. I thought they would be safe there, but my evil cousin Tatiana is in town right now. She has black and white hair and wears glasses. She’s not very nice. She really wants to steal my tricks so she can be a better magician than me. Could you please go get my tricks? But, be sure to watch out for Tatiana. She is sneaky. Please keep them safe. I really need them. I hope you can help me out with this! I’d really appreciate it! Well, I gotta go learn some new tricks. I’ll see you soon!”</p>

So, if we can just go to [name of room] and get the magic tricks we’ll make sure we keep them safe. We’ll have to keep a look out for Tatiana.”</p>
        <p>Say: “Remember that when we leave this room, our rules still apply. I can still take away sticky notes if you are not following the rules. Remember, that we will need to be respectful, stay on task, and stay together while we are traveling through the school.
