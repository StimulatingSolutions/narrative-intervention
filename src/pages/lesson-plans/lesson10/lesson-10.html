          <em>not</em> get the tricks, but students often think she will return. You may need to create a fictional story after the activity to make sure the students know that she will not return (Ex. you saw her driving away in her car, the principal has called the police to make sure she doesn’t come back, she sent you a text message saying she gives up and will not try to get the tricks again).

Gritch asking Old MacDonald where the Piggies are was caused by an event all the way at the beginning of the story. The event was also caused by the failed outcome. Gritch needed 8 piggies to make Piggie Pie, and she did not have them. This is a DISTAL cause because other events happened between these two events.
