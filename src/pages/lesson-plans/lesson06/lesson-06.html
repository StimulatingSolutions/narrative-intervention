          <strong>Say:</strong> “Okay, I see some new clues [make spyglass gesture]. The birds looked tired. The clues that told me that is that their chirping slowed down and their eyelids looked kind of closed (back up video if needed and circle clue on the screen using an O-Ring). Then the one bird looked to the left. There was a cupcake on the ledge. So, my clues are that the birds were chirping a lot, then one saw a cupcake, and then they got out of the nest and stood under the cupcake. I’m beginning to think there might be enough clues to tell me what their goal is.”
        </p>
        <p>Say: “Remember when I am making an inference about a goal I have to search for clues [make spyglass gesture]. Then I have to think about those clues [point to brain] and then I have to link them together [make interlaced fingers gesture] and use my own experiences to help make connections so that I can make an inference about the goal. So, they were chirping a lot and getting tired. Then they saw a cupcake and got out of the nest and stood under it. When I think about what I know about babies and baby birds [point to brain], when they chirp a lot they are hungry. So, I’m making a link between the clues I see in the video about them chirping, and what I know about baby birds. I think these baby birds are hungry. That’s why they were chirping so much. When they saw the cupcake, they got out of the nest and went to it. So, these clues make me think they are hungry. Now, I have to think about what their goal might be. What do they want? I think they want to get that cupcake so they can eat it. I’m going to tap/hold my GOAL card up. I think I figured it out.”</p>
