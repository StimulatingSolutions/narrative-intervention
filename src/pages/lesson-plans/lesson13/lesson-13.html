If the teacher tries to move on to the next question without tapping ‘Done,’ the ‘Done’ button will flash until it is tapped.

He made a few different tries that didn’t work. His last try was to plant a seed. Even though it took many years, eventually the tree grew tall enough and he was able to climb it to get his airplane back. This is an example of a distal cause, where one thing that happens in a story—planting a seed—caused something else to happen much later—the little boy got his airplane back.”
