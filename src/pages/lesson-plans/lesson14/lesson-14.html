    <p><em>Before the lesson begins:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Lay out the roll of Velcro fabric in a place where students can gather around it (away from primary teaching area).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Lay out Lesson 14 Magician Narrative Review pre-printed cards (Bags A-H) and a lot of Wikki Stix near the roll of fabric.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Make sure the cards in each bag are in order numerically from 1 to whatever. It is
          <em>critical</em> that the cards are in order so that the activity proceeds at a quick pace. Cards are labeled on the back with the bag letter (A-H) and card number.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use a wet erase marker to write in places where you looked for the wand on the TRY cards in Bag G.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Do NOT build any of this review before the lesson. The review is to be done with the students during the lesson.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>During the Lesson:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The board is to be built cooperatively <em>with</em> the students <em>during</em> the lesson.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use the Lesson 14 Magician Narrative Mastery Sheets to guide building the board (Lesson 14 Appendix, pp. 3-10)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Use the pre-printed cards: Magician Narrative (Bags A-H) in the Lesson 14 box to place on the board</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Teacher Role During Activity:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Teacher will remove cards from one bag (i.e., Bags A-H) at a time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Teacher will place each card down on the roll of Velcro fabric or Velcro boards while reminding students of that event.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Students should assist with recalling the events (and placing them on the board) as they are able.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Teacher will prompt students if students are not identifying the events on their own.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Co-Teacher Role During Activity:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Co-teacher will prompt students for
          <em>important</em> causal connections during this time (not all of the causal connections).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Co-teacher will prompt students if students are not identifying causal connections on their own.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Co-teacher will place wikki stix (or hand them to students to place) on the board as connections are made</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Student Role During Activity:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Assist teacher by helping to recall/retell events and help place them on the board</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Assist co-teacher by helping to retell causal connections and place them on the board</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Pacing During the Lesson</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The pace of this part of the lesson should be <em>very fast</em>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Students may jump in if they remember an event, but there are
          <em>a lot</em> of events to get through, so there should be
          <em>no pausing and waiting for students to respond</em>. Teacher should be quickly placing cards down.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>After the Lesson is Over for the Day:</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Teacher, Co-teacher, and research personnel should disassemble the board.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Look on the back of each card for the code (Bag Letter A-H; Card number)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place cards back in their appropriate bag (Bags A-H) (Cards with “A” on back go in Bag A, etc.)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Place cards in their numerical order in each bag (i.e., cards should be placed back in each bag in order from 1 to whatever)</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="hint"><p><em><strong>Prompts for Identifying Events and Causal Connections</strong></em></p>
    <p>The teacher will use prompts to guide students to identify events in the narrative. The co-teacher will use prompts to guide students to identify causal connections. The following prompts are suggestions. You do not need to ask all of the prompts below or all that are on the flowchart.

    <p>Students may try to get up or start packing their things during the wrap-up. If so they should be instructed that (1) the lesson is not over yet, (2) our group rules still apply, and (3) the teacher will let them know when it is time for them to pack up their things.</p>

        <p>Say: “Today we practiced finding goals, tries, outcomes, and causal connections. We also had to be DETECTIVES and make inferences. In
          <em>Monster and Dumpling</em>, we had to be DETECTIVES and use CLUES [make spyglass gesture] in the video to figure out that the little girl was blind. We also found an important event in the story: the monster’s growl causes the sign to fall and knock his tooth out, which causes him to get some dumplings. If he never would have growled the story would have turned out very differently!”
