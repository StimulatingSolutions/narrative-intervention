        <p>After students respond, the teacher will (1) <strong>revoice</strong> what the students said, (2) <strong>provide
          evaluative feedback</strong>, (3) ask <strong>query</strong> aimed at discerning the source of the response,
          and (4) <strong>make a connection</strong> to the lesson’s objectives.</p>
        <p>For example, if the student said, “Mr. Penny wants to get rid of the hiccups.” The teacher would respond,
          “Okay, so you’re saying that Mr. Penny wants to get rid of the hiccups is the goal in the story [revoice].
          Great [evaluative feedback]! What in the story makes you think that is his goal? [query] Okay, so you’re
          saying that Mr. Penny’s goal is to get rid of the hiccups and you know this because _____. This is the goal.
          It is a really important part of the story. So, we’re going to write it down on this thought bubble to help us

          <p>Say: “Our goal today was to bring Alex the Magician the balloons because she needs them to practice her trick
            for the party. She doesn’t live very far from here… I think she has a brick house with lots of flowers out
            front. We decided we were going to walk to her house to bring them to her. First, we tried [INSERT TRY #1],
            but we couldn’t get by because there was a painting on the floor blocking our way. The painting was very long
            and had lots of different colors of paint and said something about reading. I’m not sure who made it but they
            did a great job! We thought about walking over it but decided to TRY something else instead. We didn’t get our
            goal, so that was an outcome fail. Our next TRY was to [INSERT TRY #2] to see if we could leave that way but
            there was caution tape blocking the way. I’ve seen caution tape like that before—when my neighbors were
            getting their driveway fixed! We couldn’t go over it—we might fall and hurt ourselves! That was an outcome
            fail since we did not get our goal of bringing the balloons to Alex the Magician. We went to the (door/window)
            to try to get out that way. I’ve never gone out of the school using that (door/window). It seems like it
            should have worked, but in the end, there was a note on the (door/window) saying that it was broken. So, we
            couldn’t use it to get out. Unfortunately, that was another outcome fail since we did not get our goal of
            bringing the balloons to Alex the Magician.”</p>
