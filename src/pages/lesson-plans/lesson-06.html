<p> I also see that her legs look like she is running. I might ask, “Why is she running?” I think she might be running because the ice cream truck is about to go away. I know ice cream trucks don’t stay in one place very long, so you have to move quickly to get any ice cream.</p>

<p>[place O-ring on the clue]</p>
<p> Good thought. Anything else? Are there any other clues that tell us it’s an ice cream truck or any other clues that you see?</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, the word ice cream is on the front.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a picture of it. Good job. What else do you see?</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you’re raising your hand and not just pointing. Okay, so there’s more flavors of ice cream. What else? Do you see anything else in any of the pictures? (child’s name), what do you see? (More flavors)</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, so there are more flavors there.</p>
<p>[place O-ring on the clue]</p>
<p> Do you see anything in other pictures? You can look at the other pictures too, not just the announcement picture. What do you see?</p>
<p>[I see that there’s horns]</p></li>
<li><p>Oh, you see there is a horn to tell them that the ice cream truck is coming. Can you put that [O-ring] on there for me? Anybody see any other clues in these two pictures? What do you see?</p>
<p>[I see this is a driveway and it’s going to the other end, I think]</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, what does that help you figure out?</p>
<p>[That she’s not going into the house, she’s going to the ice cream truck]</p></li>

This is called making an inference. To make inferences first we ask ‘what happened?’</p>
<p>[Make “what happened” gesture]</p>
<p> Then we look for clues in the words or in the pictures.</p>
<p>[Make spyglass gesture]</p>
<p> Next we think about how the clues might be related,</p>
<p>[Point to brain]</p>
<p> and last we make a link to connect the clues together.</p>

<p> We can make inferences to figure out a character’s goals, tries, and outcomes.”</p>
