    <p><em><strong>Setting Up for the Magician Narrative</strong></em></p>
    <p>After the students have entered the classroom, set up the props for the Magician Narrative. Have each prop in
      one of three rooms previously decided on. ROOM 1 will have the 3 paper mâché balloons, ROOM 2 will have the
      3-balloon science experiment/lung, and ROOM 3 will have the 2 laminated balloons. The room where the balloons
      were left will have a note that says “Sorry, I had to move your balloons. I left them…” The rest of the note
      should be smudged with water/coffee so it is unreadable.</p>

        the
        character gets their goal it is an outcome yes, and if they do not get their goal it is an outcome fail. After
        we
