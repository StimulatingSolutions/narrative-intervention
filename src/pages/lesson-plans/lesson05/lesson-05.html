          <em><strong>Activity Overview</strong></em> (Please use the following guidelines in the gray boxes to help guide you to be responsive to students. There will be a generic script after the gray boxes, but these boxes should give you guidance.)
        </p>
        <p>The Teacher/Co-teacher will read the story aloud to the students.</p>
        <p><em>While</em> you are reading the story, students will work together to complete the Velcro board organizer.
        </p>
        <p>When students notice a goal, try, or outcome they should tap/hold up the respective card.</p>
        <p>Stop reading at that point and encourage students to talk to one another to figure out what is happening in the story in terms of goals, tries, outcomes, and causal connections.</p>
        <p><em>Use the following procedure while reading:</em></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Read story aloud to students until someone taps/holds up a goal/try/outcome card.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Students tap/hold up GOAL/TRY/OUTCOME cards to indicate what they noticed in the story and discuss with one another.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Write whatever students tell you to write on the appropriate GOAL, TRY, or OUTCOME card.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Students place the GOAL, TRY, or OUTCOME card where it should go on the Velcro board.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Students think about WHY (make “why” gesture) there is that goal/try/outcome and discuss with one another. Then students state that causal connection, and make the appropriate connection using a Because string on the Velcro board.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>After an OUTCOME students discuss WHAT HAPPENED [make “what happened” gesture] and discuss what the OUTCOME was with one another.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Then students think/state: Is the GOAL is still the same?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Repeat steps 1-7 for each goal/try/outcome sequence for the first 3 items that go on the hedgehog’s back (i.e, apple, nuts, green pear).</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stop mapping out the story after the try with the green pear to save time. Read the remainder of the story aloud to the students and have them place the remaining items (i.e., brown leaf, piece of blue paper, pink water lily, blackberries) on the hedgehog’s back as you read about each item.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>How to use the Hedgehog:</em></p>
        <p>As you read and encounter each TRY, place the items on the Hedgehog’s back. The teacher/co-teacher should place the first item (the apple) on the hedgehog’s back. After each try, give one student another item to be placed on the hedgehog’s back, taking turns so that each student gets a chance to place an item on the hedgehog.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Apple (Teacher/Co-teacher puts on hedgehog) (chart out)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Nuts (chart out)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Green pear (chart out)</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Brown leaf</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Piece of blue paper</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Pink water lily</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Blackberries</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The teacher should hold the items for the students, and only hand them to the students to be placed on the hedgehog
          <em>after</em> the TRY has been identified and charted on the Velcro board.</p>
        <p>Once the goat eats everything off, take the pieces off her back for the end of the story.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Do not chart</strong> the piece of brown leaf, blue paper, pink water lily, or blackberries. Just summarize them or you will run out of time.
        </p>
        <p>End by having students use the board to retell the story if time permits.</p>
