        <p>Say: “Today we practice finding distal causes and important events in stories. Remember, a distal cause is when one event in the story causes something else to happen much later. Important events help the character to get their goal, or cause lots of things to happen in the story. Important events in stories are so big that if we were to take them out the story wouldn’t make sense. In
          <em>Knuffle Bunny Too,</em> the teacher giving the girls back the wrong bunnies caused something else to happen much later in the story—the girls became friends! This is an example of a distal cause. The teacher switching the bunnies is also an example of an important event, because if that wouldn’t have happened the story would be completely different!”
