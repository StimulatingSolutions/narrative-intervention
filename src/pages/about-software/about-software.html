        Third Party Licensing and Copyright
      </ion-list-header>
      <ion-item text-wrap>
        The Narrative Structure app (webapp, Android app for teachers, and Android app for students) makes use of software
        written by third parties.  No one truly writes software "from scratch" nowadays; we all stand on the shoulders of giants.
        Although no software (in source code or binary format) written by third parties is included in the repository for
        this app's source code, some of that software is transformed, statically linked, and/or distributed within the
        running app as part of standard "vendor.js" webapp practices, and/or as part of the Android apk install files.
